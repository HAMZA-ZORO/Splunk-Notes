searching fields minimize the output values 
field names are case senesitive but values not

In the Fields sidebar, Interesting Fields occur in at least  20% of resulting events. 
= , != are used for numerical or not numerical values
> , >= , < , <= are used only for numerical

u can add fields in search bar by only cicking it

u have options like:
 | fields  , 
 | stats , 
 | rename ... as “...” , 
 | eval (used to recalculate values like from bytes to megabytes),
 |erex , |rex   (Rex is used for field extraction using regular expressions, whereas erex assists in creating those regular expressions u need to regex if using rex )

*Index time Field extraction - *
• It happens at index time when splunk indexes data.

• At index time, it extracts some default fields like source, source types and hosts.

• We can also define our custom source types, hosts so that it tags events with them.


*Search time field extraction- *
• It happens at search time when we search through data.

• It can extract additional fields other than default fields depending on its search settings.

• It includes aliasing, tagging, addition of fields from lookup. But here, you cannot change host or source type assignments.

u can make filed aliases named if employee to search better if u have fields like  User,Username,Name and gather them all in one new aliases

unindexed data can be gathered by just taking the code and discription for it to be a field   like response 200 OK
